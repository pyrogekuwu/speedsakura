  <h1 class="post-title">how to choose your first car without crying later</h1>

  <p class="post-intro">
    your first car sets the tone for your whole “car person” era.  
    choose right and you’ll love it forever. choose wrong and you’ll spend the next 6 months googling 
    “why is my engine making this noise” and messaging mechanics at 2am.  
    here’s the clean, beginner-friendly guide on picking a first car that fits your life, your budget, 
    and your sanity.
  </p>

  
  <section class="post-content">

    <h2>step 1: decide what you actually need</h2>
    <p>
      not what your pinterest board wants — what *your daily life* needs.  
      ask yourself:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>city, mixed, or mostly highway?</li>
      <li>manual or automatic?</li>
      <li>do you need a backseat or just “vibes”?</li>
      <li>tiny parking spaces near your home?</li>
      <li>budget for insurance, fuel and future repairs?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>step 2: set a real budget</h2>
    <p>
      your budget isn't just “price of the car.”  
      it’s:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>car cost</li>
      <li>first maintenance (500–2000 zł)</li>
      <li>insurance</li>
      <li>tires if needed</li>
      <li>new battery maybe</li>
      <li>unexpected “i didn’t think this would break yet” repairs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>step 3: reliability > aesthetic (unfortunately)</h2>
    <p>
      cute headlights won’t help you when your alternator dies on a monday morning.  
      look for a car known for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>cheap parts</li>
      <li>simple engines</li>
      <li>low fuel usage</li>
      <li>no complicated electronics (90s/2000s ftw)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>step 4: red flags on listings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>“only cosmetic rust” → usually not cosmetic</li>
      <li>“needs small fixes” → they always mean big fixes</li>
      <li>no photos of engine bay</li>
      <li>no interior shots → hiding something</li>
      <li>price suspiciously low for model/year</li>
      <li>seller refuses a test drive</li>
      <li>only night photos (lol run)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>step 5: what to check in person</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>cold start — smooth or rattly?</li>
      <li>smoke from exhaust?</li>
      <li>weird knocks or vibrations?</li>
      <li>rust on sills, arches, under trunk mat</li>
      <li>is oil leaking anywhere?</li>
      <li>does the clutch bite high (worn)?</li>
      <li>does it pull to one side (alignment/suspension)?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>step 6: take someone who knows cars</h2>
    <p>
      seriously. a friend, a mechanic, your uncle who complains about TDI engines.  
      an extra pair of eyes can save you thousands.
    </p>

    <h2>step 7: test drive with intention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>listen for noises when turning or braking</li>
      <li>check how gears feel</li>
      <li>does the car idle smoothly?</li>
      <li>does it overheat sitting still?</li>
      <li>do electronics all work?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>step 8: don’t let emotions win</h2>
    <p>
      yes the car is cute. yes the color is perfect. yes it looks adorable with stickers.  
      but if the engine is dying or the frame is rusted in half — don’t do it to yourself.  
      there will always be another cute one.
    </p>

    <h2>step 9: when to walk away</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>seller acts weird or avoids questions</li>
      <li>car “overheats a little”</li>
      <li>visible structural rust</li>
      <li>fresh paint on suspicious areas</li>
      <li>paperwork doesn’t match</li>
      <li>owner can’t explain maintenance history</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>step 10: celebrate your first car</h2>
    <p>
      once you find the right one, do a small first maintenance, clean it, and enjoy the freedom.  
      everyone starts somewhere — this car is the start of your whole journey.
