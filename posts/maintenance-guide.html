  <h1 class="post-title">basic maintenance checklist for people who never opened the hood</h1>

  <p class="post-intro">
    if cars make you anxious and the engine bay looks like a metal jungle — this guide is for you.  
    no technical jargon, no guilt, no “my dad says you should know this already.”  
    just the basic things you actually need to check, how often, and what happens if you ignore them.
  </p>

  
  <section class="post-content">

    <h2>1. engine oil</h2>
    <p><strong>how often:</strong> every 10–15k km or once a year</p>
    <p><strong>why:</strong> oil lubricates the engine. low or old oil = engine damage = expensive sadness.</p>
    <p><strong>how to check:</strong> pull the dipstick, wipe, insert again, check the level between MIN and MAX.  
    color should be brown/amber, not black sludge.</p>

    <h2>2. coolant (the “don’t overheat” fluid)</h2>
    <p><strong>how often:</strong> glance at it every 1–2 weeks, change every few years</p>
    <p><strong>why:</strong> prevents overheating. overheating kills engines fast.</p>
    <p><strong>how to check:</strong> look at the coolant reservoir (never open when hot!).  
    it should sit between MIN and MAX. colors differ by type — pink, green, blue are all normal.</p>

    <h2>3. brake fluid</h2>
    <p><strong>how often:</strong> every 2 years</p>
    <p><strong>why:</strong> absorbs moisture over time; old brake fluid = spongy brakes = unsafe.</p>
    <p><strong>how to check:</strong> small reservoir near the firewall. fluid should be clear yellow, not dark brown.</p>

    <h2>4. windshield washer fluid</h2>
    <p><strong>how often:</strong> whenever it’s low</p>
    <p><strong>why:</strong> visibility. also the only fluid you can’t mess up.</p>
    <p><strong>how to check:</strong> look for a cap with the windshield symbol.  
    fill it until it’s full. done. easy.</p>

    <h2>5. air filter</h2>
    <p><strong>how often:</strong> once a year or every 15–20k km</p>
    <p><strong>why:</strong> dirty filter = worse performance + higher fuel usage</p>
    <p><strong>how to check:</strong> open the airbox, take out the filter.  
    if it looks like a dusty carpet, change it.</p>

    <h2>6. tires</h2>
    <p><strong>pressure:</strong> check monthly — inside your door frame is a sticker with the correct values</p>
    <p><strong>tread:</strong> minimum legal is 1.6 mm, but 3 mm is already “change soon”</p>
    <p><strong>why:</strong> low pressure kills fuel economy + kills tires + makes the car drive like a boat</p>

    <h2>7. lights</h2>
    <p><strong>how often:</strong> check monthly</p>
    <p><strong>why:</strong> it’s illegal and dangerous to drive without working lights</p>
    <p><strong>how to check:</strong> look at reflections, ask a friend, or film the car with your phone while testing each light</p>

    <h2>8. battery</h2>
    <p><strong>how often:</strong> if your starts feel slower, get it tested</p>
    <p><strong>why:</strong> weak batteries fail suddenly (usually at the worst moment)</p>
    <p><strong>tip:</strong> if the battery is older than 5 years, plan to replace it soon.</p>

    <h2>9. belts</h2>
    <p><strong>how often:</strong> inspect yearly</p>
    <p><strong>why:</strong> cracked belts can snap and leave you stranded</p>
    <p><strong>how to check:</strong> look for cracks or fraying.  
    if unsure — just ask a mechanic during oil service.</p>

    <h2>10. cabin filter</h2>
    <p><strong>how often:</strong> every 1–2 years</p>
    <p><strong>why:</strong> cleaner air, better heater/AC performance</p>
    <p><strong>signs it’s old:</strong> foggy windows, dusty smell, weak airflow</p>

    <h2>what happens if you ignore all of this?</h2>
    <p>
      your car will still run… until one day it doesn’t.  
      small maintenance prevents big, expensive breakdowns — it’s literally the cheapest way to keep your car happy.
    </p>

    <h2>you don’t need to be a “car person” to do this</h2>
    <p>
      you can learn as you go. check one item a week.  
      after a month, you’ll feel like “okay yeah, i get this.”  
      your car will feel better, drive smoother, and stress you out way less.
