    <h1 class="post-title">toyota celica (1993–1999): the round-eyed 90s coupe that secretly wanted gravel</h1>

    <h2 class="post-undertitle">✮⋆˙ the “cute but angry” celica generation</h2>

    <p>
      The 1993–1999 Celica (ST202 / ST205 era) is peak 90s Toyota coupe energy:
      smooth curves, big round headlights and a body that looks a bit like it
      should be on a rally stage instead of stuck in traffic. It’s the generation
      that went full “soft bubble” compared to the older, boxier Celicas — and
      somehow ended up looking both sweet and slightly aggressive at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
      You see two main personalities here:
      the regular front-wheel drive Celicas that were basically stylish daily
      drivers, and the spicy GT-Four / All-Trac turbo all-wheel drive versions
      that were homologation specials pretending to be normal cars.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most people on the street met the cute FWD coupes with big rear wings and
      sunroofs, not the full rally weapon. But the rally pedigree still kind of
      hangs over the whole model — even the slow ones look like they want to be
      sideways in the snow.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-undertitle">✮⋆˙ engines: from sensible 1.8 to “why is this so serious?” gt-four</h2>

    <p>
      Under the bonnet, you get a whole ladder of 90s Toyota four-cylinders,
      depending on market and trim. At the lower end, small-displacement
      everyday engines. At the top, the legendary turbocharged 3S-GTE in the
      all-wheel drive GT-Four.
    </p>

    <h4 class="post-lin">typical 1993–1999 celica engine vibes (simplified)</h4>

    <ul class="post-list">
      <li>1.8-liter NA four (entry-level, calm, very “it just works”)</li>
      <li>2.0-liter or 2.2-liter NA fours in some markets (more torque, still chill)</li>
      <li>3S-GE high-rev NA in sportier trims (where available)</li>
      <li>3S-GTE turbo in GT-Four / All-Trac (rally-bred chaos)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The normal FWD Celicas with smaller engines aren’t fast in a modern sense,
      but they’re smooth, reliable and perfectly fine for daily driving plus
      the occasional “pretend you’re in a 90s racing game” moment on a back road.
    </p>

    <p>
      The GT-Four is a different story: turbo, intercooler, all-wheel drive and
      the kind of setup that exists because someone at Toyota needed to homologate
      a rally car and somehow convinced accounting to sign off.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-undertitle">✮⋆˙ handling: tidy FWD or rally-spec grip monster</h2>

    <p>
      In normal trims, the Celica is a tidy front-wheel-drive coupe. Light-ish
      steering, predictable front-end wash if you overcook it and a chassis that
      leans more towards “safe and friendly” than “knife-edge”. Perfect for
      daily life and occasional spirited driving, without demanding rally driver
      reflexes from you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Step up to the GT-Four and everything changes. Suddenly you’ve got:
    </p>

    <ul class="post-engines">
      <li>all-wheel drive traction that laughs at bad weather</li>
      <li>turbo torque that actually pushes you into the seat</li>
      <li>a heavier but much more serious feeling front end</li>
      <li>a vibe that says “I have opinions about gravel stages”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Most 90s kids who grew up on games and anime still see this shape and
      think “rally”, even if the car they’re looking at is just a base FWD
      version with a big wing trying its best.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-undertitle">✮⋆˙ looks: round lights, long doors, pure 90s coupe silhouette</h2>

    <p>
      The 93–99 Celica has one of the most recognizable faces of the era:
      four separate lights up front (two big round ones, two smaller) in a
      smooth nose that almost looks like it’s melted a bit in the sun.
    </p>

    <p>
      Side-on, it’s all long doors, sloping roof and a short, slightly chopped
      rear. With the right wheels and a clean ride height, the proportions are
      extremely “90s catalog car” in a good way.
    </p>

    <p>
      GT and GT-Four models often got:
    </p>

    <ul class="post-list">
      <li>factory rear spoilers of varying drama levels</li>
      <li>side skirts and subtle aero bits</li>
      <li>chunkier bumpers that make the car look lower and wider</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It’s one of those cars that can look soft and cute in light colours, and
      immediately more serious and “don’t mess with me” in darker shades with
      the right stance.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-undertitle">✮⋆˙ interior and daily life: 90s toyota, but swoopy</h2>

    <p>
      Inside, the Celica is classic 90s Toyota but with more curves: dashboard
      flowing toward the driver, simple analogue gauges, chunky steering wheel
      and seats that are more comfy cruiser than track clamp.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plastics are hard but durable, switches are satisfyingly clicky, and the
      whole layout is easy to live with. It feels like a normal car that just
      happens to be shaped like a coupe, which is exactly what most buyers
      wanted at the time.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a daily, it gives you:
    </p>

    <ul class="post-engines">
      <li>enough practicality with the hatch and folding rear seats</li>
      <li>just enough drama when you walk up to it in a car park</li>
      <li>90s reliability if you keep up with basic maintenance</li>
      <li>that little “I drive something slightly special” feeling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-undertitle">✮⋆˙ why it’s a great “starter coupe” (if you can find one)</h2>

    <p>
      As a car model, the 1993–1999 Celica makes a lot of sense if you’re:
    </p>

    <ul class="post-list">
      <li>craving 90s Japanese coupe vibes without going full wallet-death</li>
      <li>okay with FWD but want something that looks like it watched too much WRC</li>
      <li>planning light mods: wheels, mild drop, exhaust, maybe OEM+ aero</li>
      <li>wanting a car that feels special but still does normal life things</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The GT-Four variants are more collector / hardcore toy territory now,
      but the regular Celicas still work beautifully as dailyable nostalgia
      machines. They’re pretty, easy to drive, and just different enough from
      modern blobs to feel like a little time machine.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s not the fastest, not the rarest, and not the loudest JDM name —
      but if you want 90s coupe energy with a hint of rally fantasy, this
      Celica generation fits that perfectly.
    </p>
