  <h1 class="post-title">how to change wheels and tires</h1>

  <p class="post-intro">
    swapping wheels sounds scary the first time — jack points? torque? why won’t this wheel come off??  
    don’t worry. this guide walks you through the full process safely, calmly, and without the classic 
    “help it’s stuck” meltdown. perfect for beginners doing seasonal tire swaps or upgrading to a cute new set.

  <section class="post-content">

    <h2>what you need</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>car jack (scissor jack works, floor jack is better)</li>
      <li>jack stands (safety!)</li>
      <li>wheel wrench or breaker bar</li>
      <li>torque wrench (for tightening correctly)</li>
      <li>wd-40 or penetrating oil (optional but useful)</li>
      <li>rubber mallet (for stuck wheels)</li>
      <li>wire brush for cleaning hub face</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. park safely</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>flat, solid ground (no grass, no slope)</li>
      <li>handbrake on</li>
      <li>car in gear or “P”</li>
      <li>wheel chocks or bricks behind opposite wheels</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. loosen the lug nuts *before* lifting</h2>
    <p>
      step on the wrench with your foot if needed — they can be really tight.  
      just loosen, don’t remove. this prevents the wheel from spinning in the air.
    </p>

    <h2>3. find the correct jack point</h2>
    <p>
      look for reinforced metal pinch welds or marked jack pads under the car.  
      never jack on random plastic or thin metal — it will bend.
    </p>

    <h2>4. lift the car</h2>
    <p>
      raise until the wheel hangs freely. slide a jack stand under a solid point and lower the car onto it.  
      never work with only the jack holding the car — they can slip.
    </p>

    <h2>5. remove the wheel</h2>
    <p>
      now take off the lug nuts fully. pull the wheel straight toward you.
    </p>

    <h3>if the wheel is stuck</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>kick the sidewall with your heel (not the rim)</li>
      <li>wheel still not moving? hit the rubber lightly with a mallet</li>
      <li>spray penetrating oil between wheel & hub and wait 2–3 mins</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. clean the hub face</h2>
    <p>
      use a wire brush to remove rust so the new wheel sits flush.  
      this prevents vibration and makes wheel removal easier next time.
    </p>

    <h2>7. mount the new wheel</h2>
    <p>
      line up the holes and slide it on. hand-tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern.
    </p>

    <h2>8. lower the car</h2>
    <p>
      remove jack stands and slowly lower the car back to the ground.
    </p>

    <h2>9. torque properly</h2>
    <p>
      use a torque wrench and tighten in a <strong>star pattern</strong>.  
      each car has its torque spec — usually 90–120 Nm, but check your manual or online.
    </p>

    <h2>10. re-check after driving</h2>
    <p>
      drive 20–30 km and re-torque the lug nuts. wheels can settle slightly.
    </p>

    <h2>extra tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>never oil the lug nuts — they must stay dry</li>
      <li>if using spacers, torque them separately</li>
      <li>store off-season wheels flat or on racks, not stacked against sidewalls</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>you’ve done it!</h2>
    <p>
      changing wheels gets easier every time.  
      once you know jack points and torque, the whole process feels natural — 
      and honestly kinda satisfying. welcome to the “i can do my own wheels” club.
