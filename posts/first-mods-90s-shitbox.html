  <h1 class="post-title">first mods for a 90s shitbox</h1>

  <p class="post-intro">
    90s cars are the perfect “starter pack” for modding: cheap enough to experiment on, simple enough to wrench on, 
    and full of that charming jank. here’s a list of first mods that actually change how your car feels — 
    without swallowing your entire monthly budget.

    <h2>1. intake upgrade (the cheap but effective one)</h2>
    <p>
      lots of 90s cars have old, restrictive intake boxes. a simple panel filter or a cold-air style intake 
      gives you better throttle response and a nicer sound — not huge horsepower, but enough to feel alive.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>panel filter: cheap, reliable, drop-in</li>
      <li>cone intake: louder, better response, fits the aesthetic</li>
      <li>avoid extremely hot engine bay placements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. exhaust — the right way</h2>
    <p>
      don’t go straight to “straight pipe everything.” a good cat-back or axle-back system gives better flow 
      and a cleaner tone. older engines sound surprisingly good with a little refinement.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>cat-back = best balance</li>
      <li>axle-back = budget-friendly</li>
      <li>straight pipe = fun until it drones on the highway and your neighbors hate you</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. wheels & tires — the mod that changes everything</h2>
    <p>
      lightweight wheels + good tires make your car handle like it actually wants to live another decade.  
      this is one of the most dramatic improvements you can feel instantly.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>go one size up, not three — keep acceleration</li>
      <li>tires matter way more than wheel brand</li>
      <li>a gentle drop + better wheels transforms the look</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. suspension refresh (stock but new)</h2>
    <p>
      your 90s shocks are probably dead. even replacing them with OEM-quality new ones changes the whole car.  
      if you want more, add lowering springs or mid-range coilovers — but start with fresh basics.
    </p>

    <h2>5. bushings & mounts</h2>
    <p>
      old rubber = sloppy steering, sloppy shifting, sloppy everything.  
      cheap polyurethane or upgraded rubber bushings make the car feel “tight” again.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>shifter bushings (big difference)</li>
      <li>sway bar bushings</li>
      <li>engine mounts (mild increase in vibration but dramatic improvement in feel)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. interior upgrades</h2>
    <p>
      this is the fun part: swapping out the peeling wheel, adding a short shifter, stereo upgrade, or cute essentials 
      like a new shift knob. 90s interiors get crusty — small touches make them feel new.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>shift knob</li>
      <li>steering wheel (with correct hub!)</li>
      <li>better speakers</li>
      <li>deep clean + fabric dye</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. maintenance-as-modding (the unsexy but real mod)</h2>
    <p>
      spark plugs, fluids, belts, filters — all of this makes your car faster than half the “mods” people do.  
      a healthy engine responds better to every upgrade.
    </p>

    <h2>8. bonus cheap mods that actually slap</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>LED interior lights</li>
      <li>weighted shift knob</li>
      <li>cleaning the throttle body</li>
      <li>sway bar upgrade</li>
      <li>fresh brake pads + fluid</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>the truth about first mods</h2>
    <p>
      the best mods for a 90s shitbox aren’t the flashiest ones — they’re the ones that make the car feel solid.  
      once the basics are refreshed and the car drives properly, <i>then</i> you go wild: stance, power, paint, itasha, 
      whatever fits your vision.
