  <h1 class="post-title">cheap interior glow-up: wheel, shifter & seats</h1>

  <p class="post-intro">
    you spend more time <i>inside</i> the car than looking at it from across the parking lot.  
    so if your steering wheel is shiny and cracked, the shifter feels like a loose spoon in soup, 
    and the seats look like a bus from 1994 — this is your sign. here’s how to give your cabin a proper glow-up 
    without touching your engine or your entire savings.

    <h2>step 1: deep clean before you mod</h2>
    <p>
      vacuum, plastics cleaner, fabric cleaner, glass. pull out floor mats, clean all the crumbs from 2007, 
      wipe the sticky buttons. half of an “interior build” is just removing grime.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>clean steering wheel and shifter first (you touch them the most)</li>
      <li>scrub pedals, door cards, center console</li>
      <li>use a soft brush around vents and buttons</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>steering wheel: what you hold all the time</h2>
    <p>
      the wheel is the biggest “feel” mod. options depend on your budget and how OEM you want to stay.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>nice cover</strong> — easiest, cheapest, hides wear</li>
      <li><strong>re-wrapped wheel</strong> — stock shape, new material</li>
      <li><strong>aftermarket wheel + hub</strong> — for full tuner vibes (check legality + airbag laws!)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      materials: leather, suede, alcantara or even cute printed covers if you’re going kawaii.  
      thick, slightly smaller-diameter wheels feel more “sporty” even in a slow car.
    </p>

    <h2>shifter: tiny part, big difference</h2>
    <p>
      a new shift knob + fresh boot makes the whole center area look new.  
      short shifters can improve feel, but even just weight and shape matter.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>weighted knobs = more satisfying shifts</li>
      <li>taller knobs for comfy cruising, shorter for “clicky” feel</li>
      <li>match colors to wheel / seats / trim</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>seat covers & cushions: faking new seats</h2>
    <p>
      90s seats are usually stained, saggy, or both. full seat replacements are expensive, 
      but good seat covers can change the entire vibe.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>avoid ultra-thin, baggy covers (taxi spec)</li>
      <li>look for tailored or semi-tailored covers</li>
      <li>add lumbar cushions if you daily drive a lot</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      if you do go for bucket seats or aftermarket seats, check:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>mounting rails for your car model</li>
      <li>comfort on longer trips, not just photos</li>
      <li>local rules about airbags and seat swaps</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>small details that change the mood</h2>
    <p>
      this is where you can go full aesthetic: 
      anime, jdm, pink, minimal, cyberpunk — whatever you want.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>floor mats (cute or OEM-style, but clean)</li>
      <li>keychain and lanyard</li>
      <li>LED interior lights (warm white or soft color)</li>
      <li>dash tray for small items</li>
      <li>phone mount that doesn’t look awful</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>don’t forget: practicality & safety</h2>
    <p>
      no huge plushies blocking mirrors, no 17 things hanging from your rearview, 
      no sharp metal where airbags might go off. cute is good, safe is better.
    </p>

    <h2>the glow-up mindset</h2>
    <p>
      interior glow-up is about making the car feel like <i>yours</i>.  
      you don’t need a full show build — just a wheel you like to grab, a shifter that feels nice, 
      seats that don’t hurt, and small details that make you smile when you open the door.
