    <h1 class="post-title">mitsubishi eclipse 2005: the porsche-looking shark that fooled everyone</h1>

    <h2 class="post-undertitle">✮⋆˙ where it sits in eclipse history</h2>

    <p>
      The 2005 Mitsubishi Eclipse belongs to the third generation of the model,
      sold from 2000 to 2005. By this point the Eclipse had already gone through
      its legendary 90s turbo AWD phase and shifted toward something more mainstream:
      a front-wheel-drive, comfy, boulevard coupe that still looked sporty enough
      to turn heads in a supermarket parking lot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mitsubishi designed this generation for people who wanted the fantasy of a
      sports car without the reality of stiff suspension, noisy drivetrains and
      fragile tuners-only engines. The idea was simple: give buyers a low, wide,
      dramatic shape with big rear hips and a “baby Porsche” roofline, then pack
      it with enough comfort and equipment so it could work as a daily, not just
      a weekend toy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Underneath, the third-gen Eclipse moved away from the hardcore DSM era and
      shared more with regular FWD Mitsubishis. No AWD, no factory turbo, and a
      suspension tuned more for stability and cruising than for track days. That
      annoyed purists, but for most buyers in the early 2000s it made sense:
      insurance was cheaper, reliability was decent, and the car felt familiar
      rather than intimidating.
    </p>

    <p>
      2005 is the last model year for this generation, so it’s kind of a “final
      form” version: the styling had settled in, the V6 models had a clear role
      as the more serious option, and the Eclipse was already getting ready to
      morph into the chunkier fourth-gen coupe that followed.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-undertitle">✮⋆˙ powertrains and personality</h2>

    <p>
      Engine options depended on market and trim, but in general the 2005 Eclipse
      gives you two main flavours:
    </p>

    <ul class="post-list">
      <li>2.4-liter inline-four (GS / RS in some markets)</li>
      <li>3.0-liter V6 (GT / GTS)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The four-cylinder is the sensible one: enough torque for daily driving,
      decent fuel economy, and not trying to pretend it’s a race car. Paired with
      a manual, it’s light enough at the front to still feel playful if you’re
      in the mood to throw it into a corner.
    </p>

    <p>
      The 3.0 V6 is where the “fake Porsche” fantasy kicks in. It doesn’t make
      massive power by modern standards, but it has that smooth, slightly lazy
      early-2000s V6 character, with a nice growl when you rev it out. It fits
      the car’s vibe perfectly: more grand-tourer-for-students than track weapon.
    </p>

    <h4 class="post-lin">3.0 V6 (GT / GTS) highlights</h4>

    <ul class="post-list">
      <li>around 200 hp depending on trim and market</li>
      <li>smooth, linear power delivery</li>
      <li>enough torque to feel relaxed on the highway</li>
      <li>automatic or manual, both common</li>
      <li>more weight over the nose, but also more “grown-up” feel</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Typical four-cylinder Eclipse traits:</p>

    <ul class="post-engines">
      <li>cheaper to buy and run</li>
      <li>simpler engine bay for DIY maintenance</li>
      <li>less drama, more “cute daily with a coupe body”</li>
      <li>easier to live with if you commute a lot</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The third-gen Eclipse is very much a product of its time: it wants to look
      fast and a bit aggressive, but underneath it’s tuned to be friendly.
      It’s the kind of car you can take to work all week, then spend the weekend
      washing, polishing and photographing from low angles pretending you’re in
      an early-2000s tuner magazine.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-undertitle">✮⋆˙ why people clown on it… and why i still love it</h2>

    <p>
      Among car nerds, the 2000–2005 Eclipse has a complicated reputation.
      If you say “Eclipse” online, people immediately think of the earlier turbo
      AWD monsters from the 90s. Compared to those, the 2005 model looks like a
      sell-out: no turbo, no AWD, heavier, softer, and clearly aimed at people
      who care more about styling than lap times.
    </p>

    <p>
      But that’s also what makes it interesting now. The car leans hard into
      aesthetics: the wide rear, the almost-Porsche-like roofline, the sharky
      front bumper, the long doors, the way it sits low and slightly chunky at
      the same time. It’s dramatic and a little bit over the top, which fits
      perfectly with the era of body kits, neon and burned “Fast & Furious”
      DVDs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another reason it never became legendary is that it landed right when the
      market was shifting. Hot hatches and sedans were getting faster and more
      practical, SUVs were starting to eat everything, and the “affordable FWD
      coupe” niche was slowly dying. For a lot of people the Eclipse was just
      a stylish alternative to a normal compact car, not a hero car to obsess
      over for decades.
    </p>

    <p>
      And yet, if you look at it now with some distance, the 2005 Eclipse has
      a specific charm: it’s unapologetically 2000s. Big heavy steering wheel,
      chunky dashboard, slightly plasticky interior, but also a feeling that the
      car is on your side. It wants you to cruise, blast music and enjoy the
      way it looks in shop windows.
    </p>

    <p>
      For enthusiasts today, it’s also a canvas. You can lean into the “baby
      Porsche” vibe with clean paint, subtle drop and nice wheels, or go full
      period-correct tuner with side skirts, loud exhaust and anime stickers.
      It’s not a perfect driver’s car, but it’s a perfect <em>project</em> car:
      dramatic lines, tons of visual potential, and just enough performance to
      be fun without being scary.
    </p>

    <p>
      So no, the 2005 Eclipse isn’t the fastest or most pure version of the name.
      But if you grew up seeing them in games, magazines or parked under orange
      street lights, there’s something incredibly satisfying about the idea of
      owning one now — especially in a bright color, slightly lowered, and sitting
      on wheels that actually fill those giant arches properly.
